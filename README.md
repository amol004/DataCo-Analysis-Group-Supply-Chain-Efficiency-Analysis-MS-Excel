# Supply-Chain-Efficiency-Analysis-MS-Excel

**Background:**

DataCo Analysis Group, a leading consultancy in business analytics, specializes in providing comprehensive insights into various industry sectors. This case study, "Streamline & Spotlight," focuses on the intersection of supply chain operations and digital consumer behavior. With a detailed dataset encompassing supply chain metrics (DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv) and digital access logs (TokenizedAccessLogs.csv), DataCo Analysis Group plays an instrumental role in helping businesses optimize their operations and understand digital engagement. The supply chain dataset offers insights into sales, logistics, and delivery performance, while the access logs shed light on consumer online interactions and preferences. In an era where efficient supply chain management and robust digital presence are crucial for business success, analyzing these datasets becomes imperative to uncover strategies for operational excellence and enhanced digital outreach.

**Objective:**

The objective of this case study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the combined supply chain and digital access datasets provided by DataCo Analysis Group. Students will utilize advanced Excel techniques to dissect these datasets, revealing key patterns and insights. The primary tasks include data cleaning, integration, analysis, and the development of a comprehensive, interactive dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a critical tool in visualizing supply chain efficiencies, customer engagement metrics, and the synergy between them. The project aims to augment DataCo Analysis Group's consulting capabilities, offering actionable insights to clients for optimizing supply chain processes and improving digital marketing strategies. This analysis is also expected to contribute to a broader understanding of how supply chain and online consumer behavior are interlinked, thereby influencing strategic decisions in product management, marketing, and customer relationship management.
